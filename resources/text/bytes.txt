Byte is a unit of digital information that consists of eight bits. A single byte can be used to represent 256 different values.

Similary to the chart presented for flows we can observe the same shape for the chart ilustrated number of bytes per time relation. However here we can notice 4 picks between 12:00 and 18:00. The first one occured somwhere around 1 p.m., the second around 3 p.m. and the last 2 picks can be observe shrtly before 6 p.m. On the chart presented number of flows in time those picks were not so clearly presented. I suspect that this is because of the granularity of the data. Amount of bytes is by 5 orders of magnitude more than the number of flows for the same time (bytes - 10^11, whereas flows are 10^6).
