The relation between used data (define as number of flows, bytes or packets) in time interval for a regular working day is not typical from the perspective of household or corporate network. The first network might have thier pick in data traffick after working hours, where all are at home, where the second would have the top volumes between 9:00 and 17:00 where the most employees are at work. Students life varies from the other 2 mentioned here. They have classes in a different times therefore from 12:00 till midnight we can observe relatively constant and on high level data traffick in the university campus.

It is important to measure and understand what happens in the network, what are the volumes and types of traffic in order to properly manage it, for troubleshooting, detecting security incidents. This work definitely did not answer all those questions but it shows that with use of some tools like nfdump (to gather network logs) and python modules together with reliable hardware, which can handle such a big amount of data we are able to find some trends in usage of the network under our management.
