The most universal definition of traffic flow in packet network is a sequence of packets which share a common property. In this work flow is defined as a unidirectional sequence of packets that share the same five-tuple: IP source address,  IP  destination  address,  source  port,  destination port, and transport layer protocol type.

In the below presented chart we can see the relation between time and number of flows. Starting from midnight 08-06-2015 the amount of flows descreasing untill 6 a.m. after that we can observe constant growth and the pick is located somewhere about 1 p.m. By the midnight at the next day (09-06-2015) the amount of flows drops 40% compares to the highest amount at 1 p.m.
